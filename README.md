AUTOMATIC STYLES GUIDE
======================

A Style Guide that outputs most standard HTML elements, with the styles from your website.

## Dependencies

CodeKit 1 or CodeKit 2 (this project uses the .kit methods).

The styles are written in LESS.

This project is written in HTML, LESS, and Javascript: it has no server-side language dependencies.

## Install

Put the ```style-guide``` folder in the ```base-install``` folder of your project.
    
### Set up

When you have put the files and folder in the right place, open the ```style-guide/config.kit``` file. This allows you to put in your project name, and project CSS path.

```
<!-- KIT VARIABLE == ENTER THE NAME OF YOUR PROJECT HERE -->
<!-- $projectName = [Project X] -->

<!-- KIT VARIABLE == ENTER THE DESCRIPTION OF YOUR PROJECT HERE -->
<!-- $projectDescription = [Description of Project X] -->

<!-- KIT VARIABLE == ENTER THE PATH TO YOUR PROJECT'S CSS FILE -->
<!-- $projectCSSPath = ../css/styles.css -->

<!-- KIT VARIABLE == ENTER A "HOW TO USE" HERE -->
<!-- $sgHowTo = This style guide shows how each of the elements within your website works. Click on "View Source" and you can then find the HTML that will generate the look and feel that you want. -->

```

### Colour config

This is a little trickier, since there are a lot of variables (although more automation might be introduced later). Set up is mainly done in ```style-guide/colour-config.less```

This file tells the Style Guide where to find your colours file (check the path).

You may also need to modify ```style-guide/kit-snippets/colours.kit``` depending on how many brand colours you have. Currently, the project is set up to accept three brand colours, but templates for extending this are covered.

### Top Menu

The Top Menu will be built automatically from the ```<h2 class="sg-element">```

### HTML Mark-up

Wrap your elements in this:

Wrap snippets in ```<div data-xrayhtml="flip" class="prism zeroclip"><p>Code here</p></div>```

### Adding more HTML elements

Create a new ```.kit``` file in ```style-guide/kit-snippets```, and write your HTML into it.

Then open ```index.kit```, and scroll to where the snippets are called (around ```line 70```). Then call your new file: ```<!-- @import "kit-snippets/[your-file-name]" -->``` (you do not need to include the ```.kit``` extension in your call).

## Credits (so far)

The code and its presentation is generated by [Filament Group's XRayHTML project](https://github.com/filamentgroup/X-rayHTML).

The menu is built automatically using [Janko's Table of Contents script](http://www.jankoatwarpspeed.com/automatically-generate-table-of-contents-using-jquery/)

The smooth scroll uses [a snippet from CSS Tricks](http://css-tricks.com/snippets/jquery/smooth-scrolling/)

The project uses [Bryan Jones's most excellent CodeKit](http://incident57.com/codekit/index.html) [.kit language](http://incident57.com/codekit/help.html#kit) to provide ```variables``` and ```includes```, and for compiling the [LESS](http://lesscss.org).

*LESS and CodeKit 2 are the best things to happen to front-end development since CSS. Fact.*
