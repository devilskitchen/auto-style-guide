Auto Style Guide
================

A Style Guide with a lot of automatic build features.

## Install

Put these files in the root of your project:

    /style-guide.kit
    /style-guide.html
    /style-guide/

## Top Menu

The Top Menu will be built automatically from the ````<h2 class="sg-element">````

## HTML Mark-up

Wrap your elements in this:

Wrap snippets in ```<div data-xrayhtml="flip" class="prism zeroclip"><p>Code here</p></div>````

## This ain't done yet

There's more to come: I suggest that you clone the project, and then you'll know when it has been updated.
